                <h1><b>LICENSE TO WED</b></h1>
                <p>
                    One summer day in 1957, we headed to the courthouse for a marriage license. My husband-to-be, Steve,
                    asked the clerk for a fishing license. She advised him a fishing license cost $1.50 and a marriage
                    license cost $2.50. With some thought and a smile, he chose the marriage license, and so our life
                    together, later filled with two children, began. Whenever we had a disagreement, I would remind my
                    husband that he could have saved money had he chosen a fishing license, and it would have expired in
                    a year. The extra dollar cost him 53 years of wedded bliss.<br>

                <p>
                    In mythology, humans had four arms, four legs, and two faces. Fearing them, Zeus split them into
                    two, forcing an eternal search for their other half. Zeus failed. When my (now) husband arrived at
                    my house for our first date, I opened the door to my other half, dressed exactly like me, head to
                    toe: aviator Ray-Bans, Levis, Timberland boots, the same yellow ski jacket. After our amazed
                    laughter, he said, “One of us has to change.” I changed my clothes but not my mind. I knew we’d be
                    together forever.<br>

                <p>
                    Having just cemented a new bridge, my dental-assistant mother said to her patient, “Your
                    girlfriend’s going to love your new teeth.” He replied, “I’m between girlfriends right now.” She
                    said, “Don’t go anywhere. I have two daughters, Kathy and Vicky. Let me get their pictures from my
                    wallet.” Dan was still reclined in the dental chair with his bib on and wasn’t going anywhere.
                    Rushing back, she showed him her daughters’ photos, saying, “Here is our phone number. Give Kathy a
                    call—she’s the older one.” He called, and we’ve been happily married for 39 years. Thanks, Mom!<br>

        <h1><b>THE MAN WHO MOVED A MOUNTAIN</b></h1>
        <p>
            There are people who say love can move mountains. This might not be physically possible, but Dashrath
            Manjhi, also known as the ‘Mountain Man’, came quite close. In one day of his life, his wife fell while
            crossing a nearby hill and hurt herself seriously. She needed quick medical assistance, but that wasn’t
            possible due to the hill that isolated their small village from the next town. Tragically enough, his wife
            died from the serious injuries before Dashrath could do anything about it. It was the night when Dashrath
            Manjhi decided to carve a small path through the mountain in order to give his village easier access to
            medical assistance. It was an ambitious plan and he was heavily ridiculed for it. But after working for 22
            years with the greatest determination and willpower, a path was carved into the hill. Even though he was
            initially mocked and ridiculed for his mission to give his hometown easier access to the nearby town, he
            finally succeeded. His life’s work helped to reduce the distance between the two towns from 55 km to only 15
            km, so that never again such a thing would happen.<br>
