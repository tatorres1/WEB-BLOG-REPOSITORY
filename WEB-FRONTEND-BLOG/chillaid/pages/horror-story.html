                <h1><b>THIS NEW OLD HOUSE</b></h1>
                <p>
                    We bought an old house, my boyfriend and I. He's in charge of the "new" construction – converting
                    the kitchen in to the master bedroom for instance, while I'm on wallpaper removal duty. The previous
                    owner papered EVERY wall and CEILING! Removing it is brutal, but oddly satisfying. The best feeling
                    is getting a long peel, similar to your skin when you're peeling from a sunburn. I don't know about
                    you but I kinda make a game of peeling, on the hunt for the longest piece before it rips.Under a
                    corner section of paper in every room is a person’s name and a date. Curiosity got the best of me
                    one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered the person was actually a missing person,
                    the missing date matching the date under the wallpaper! The next day, I made a list of all the names
                    and dates. Sure enough each name was for a missing person with dates to match. We notified the
                    police who naturally sent out the crime scene team. I overhead one tech say "yup, it's human."
                    Human? What's human? "Ma'am, where is the material you removed from the walls already? This isn't
                    wallpaper you were removing."<br>

                    He awoke to the huge, insect like creatures looming over his bed and screamed his lungs out. They
                    hastily left the room and he stayed up all night, shaking and wondering if it had been a dream.The
                    next morning, there was a tap on the door. Gathering his courage, he opened it to see one of them
                    gently place a plate filled with fried breakfast on the floor, then retreat to a safe distance.
                    Bewildered, he accepted the gift. The creatures chittered excitedly.This happened every day for
                    weeks. At first he was worried they were fattening him up, but after a particularly greasy breakfast
                    left him clutching his chest from heartburn, they were replaced with fresh fruit. As well as
                    cooking, they poured hot steamy baths for him and even tucked him in when he went to bed. It was
                    bizarre.One night, he awoke to gunshots and screaming. He raced downstairs to find a decapitated
                    burglar being devoured by the insects. He was sickened, but disposed of the remains as best he
                    could.<br> He knew they had just been protecting him.One morning the creatures wouldn't let him
                    leave
                    his room. He lay down, confused but trusting as they ushered him back into bed. Whatever their
                    motives, they weren't going to hurt him.Hours later a burning pain spread throughout his body. It
                    felt like his stomach was filled with razor wire. The insects chittered as he spasmed and moaned. It
                    was only when he felt a terrible squirming feeling beneath his skin that he realised the insects
                    hadn't been protecting him. They had been protecting their young<br>

                <h1><b>NOt A LOVE STORY</b></h1>
                <p>
                    Everyone loves the first day of school, right? New year, new classes, new friends. It's a day full
                    of potential and hope, before all the dreary depressions of reality show up to ruin all the fun.I
                    like the first day of school for a different reason, though. You see, I have a sort of power. When I
                    look at people, I can...sense a sort of aura around them. A colored outline based on how long that
                    person has to live. Most everyone I meet around my age is surrounded by a solid green hue, which
                    means they have plenty of time left.A fair amount of them have a yellow-orangish tinge to their
                    auras, which tends to mean a car crash or some other tragedy. Anything that takes people "before
                    their time" as they say.The real fun is when the auras venture into the red end of the spectrum,
                    though. Every now and again I'll see someone who's basically a walking stoplight. Those are the ones
                    who get murdered or kill themselves. It's such a rush to see them and know their time is
                    numbered.With that in mind, I always get to class very early so I can scout out my classmates'
                    fates. The first kid who walked in was basically radiating red. I chuckled to myself. Too damn bad,
                    bro. But as people kept walking in, they all had the same intense glow. I finally caught a glimpse
                    of my rose-tinted reflection in the window, but I was too stunned to move. Our professor stepped in
                    and locked the door, his aura a sickening shade of green.<br>

        <h1><b>TIMEKEEPER</b></h1>
        <p>
            He had been given the watch on his tenth birthday. It was an ordinary grey plastic wristwatch in every
            respect except for the fact that it was counting down. "That is all of the time you have left in the world,
            son. Use it wisely." And indeed he did. As the watch ticked away, the boy, now a man, lived life to the
            fullest. He climbed mountains and swam oceans. He talked and laughed and lived and loved. The man was never
            afraid, for he knew exactly how much time he had left.Eventually, the watch began its final countdown. The
            old man stood looking over everything he had done, everything he had built. 5. He shook hands with his old
            business partner, the man who had long been his friend and confidant. 4. His dog came and licked his hand,
            earning a pat on the head for its companionship. 3. He hugged his son, knowing that he had been a good
            father. 2. He kissed his wife on the forehead one last time. 1. The old man smiled and closed his eyes.
<BR>
            Then, nothing happened. The watch beeped once and turned off. The man stood standing there, very much alive.
            You would think that in that moment he would have been overjoyed. Instead, for the first time in his life,
            the man was scared.<br>
